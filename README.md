### Abstract from report
Nowadays, the practice of removing objects from images and videos for different purposes is very common in different areas as photography and video edition, cinema industry, and so forth. Moreover, it can also be used maliciously hacking the feed of cameras as surveillance cameras. 
Due to its great relevance, there are a broad number of methods trying to solve this problem and some of them are briefly mentioned in the present work. In the present project, we employ two approaches attempting to address the problem of removing people from a video using object segmentation, background subtraction, and image inpainting.
